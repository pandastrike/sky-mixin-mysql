    password:
      description: >
        Required credentials for the MySQL database deployment. DO NOT PROVIDE THE PASSWORD HERE AS PLAINTEXT. Instead, within the AWS Secrets Manger, store a secret with keys "username" and "password", storing the database's master username and password, respectively.  Whatever you choose to name that secret, provide that reference name here.  This mixin will confirm that such a secret exists within this region and use CloudFormation's parameter handling to securely use that value without storing it in plaintext anywhere.

    backupWindow:
      description: >
        Optional specification of the window of time where a database backup can be made.  Given in UTC in the format hh:mm-hh:mm. Cannot overlap with maintenanceWindow. Defaults to "06:00-07:00", which is 11pm - 12am PST.

        Optional specification of the window of time where system maintenance may occur, including version upgrades.  Given in UTC in the format ddd:hh:mm-ddd:hh:mm.  Cannot overlap with backupWindow.  Defaults to "Wed:07:00-Wed:08:00", which is 12am - 1am PST Wednesday mornings.

    kmsKey:
      description: >
        Optional specification of the KMS key to use to encrypt data at rest.  MySQL uses KMS to encrypt/decrypt data with minimal performance impact.  This mixin does not create a KMS key for you and will throw an error if it cannot find the key.  Omitting this field will leave your data unencrypted at rest.

    capacity:
      description: >
        This mixin launches an Aurora database running the MySQL engine in serverless mode, an on-demand, auto-scaling configuration.  For metering, AWS uses "Aurora Capacity Units" (ACUs). 1 ACU has approximately 2 GB of memory with corresponding CPU and networking, similar to what is used in Aurora user-provisioned instances.

        Aurora will automatically scale your database to minimize your resource costs while accomodating increases in traffic. In this configuration, you provide the minimum and maximum bounds for that capacity, given in ACUs.

        Valid capacity values are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256. The maximum capacity must be greater than or equal to the minimum capacity.
